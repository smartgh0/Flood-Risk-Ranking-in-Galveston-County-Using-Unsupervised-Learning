<li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Separate target variable (Zipcodes) from the selected features.</li>
        <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Applied MinMaxScaler to normalize data, ensuring all features were on a similar scale for clustering analysis.</li>
	<li>
	TotalZestimate was dropped because it had very high values as compared to other features.
