    <h1>PCA</h1>
    <p>
	     Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

    Purpose: Initially used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and capture the most important variance across features.
    Outcome: Although PCA provided insights, it was ultimately rejected in favor of t-SNE due to better performance in preserving local structure.
