    <h1>Data Cleaning</h1>
    <p>
	    Data Wrangling:

    <p>Initial Dataset: 21 columns and 516 observations, combining geographical, environmental, and socio-economic factors.</p>
	
    <p>Cleaning: Removed missing values, standardized formats, and filtered irrelevant data to ensure accuracy and consistency.</p>
    <p>Feature Engineering: Created new features from existing data to enhance model performance, including risk indices and proximity scores.</p>
    <p>Normalization: Applied MinMaxScaler to normalize data, ensuring all features were on a similar scale for clustering analysis.</p>
	<li>
	TotalZestimate was dropped because it had very high values as compared to other features.
